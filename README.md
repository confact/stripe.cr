Stripe API wrapper for Crystal.

This version (>1.0) is changed to follow Ruby's method and class structure. We will follow `Stripe::Class.method` but follow crystal parameters to take care of the types automatically.

### Notice

This api wrapper was tested on api version `2020-03-02` but have been trying to make it flexible with `String?` and correspondent in the types.

## Installation

Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  stripe:
    github: confact/stripe.cr
```

## Usage

```crystal
require "stripe"

Stripe.api_key = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"

token = Stripe::Token.create(card: {
  number: "4242424242424242",
  exp_month: 12,
  exp_year: 2019,
  cvc: 123,
})

customer = Stripe::Customer.create(source: token)
charge = Stripe::Charge.create(amount: 1000, currency: "usd", customer: customer)
```

### custom API version

You can set custom api version if needed.
Version need to be set before first api call is called. otherwise it won't be used.

```crystal
require "stripe"

Stripe.api_key = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"
Stripe.version = "2019-03-29"
```

### Example of setting up a subscription

Here is a simple way to setup a subscription by using payment_method.

Follow the instruction for setting up an subscription at stripe: [https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription)

When the step is at server code, check the code below that is corresponding towards the ruby code for same step.

Setting up an customer:

```crystal
  token = params['StripeToken'] # or what the param for the token is called for you.
  customer = Stripe::Customer.create(email: email,
                         description: name, # just example
                         payment_method: token, # or token.payment_method.id
                         # depends what you do in the frontend to handle the token.
                         invoice_settings: { default_payment_method: token })

```

create a subscription with that customer:

```crystal
Stripe::Subscription.create(customer: customer,
plan: STRIPE_PLAN_ID,
expand: ["latest_invoice.payment_intent"]) # yes - create_subscription support expand.
```

The rest is frontend to check SCA and more. You should not need to do more than this on the backend.

But follow [https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) for the frontend part to make sure it works for SCA and other things.
